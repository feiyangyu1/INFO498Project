# INFO498Project

For this final project, the task is to create a database for a patient-doctor appointment system and load all the data into it. The new patient visit data are created and needed to be imported to the database consistently from the csv files. This ETL process would be divided into two parts: from csv files to OLTP database, from OLTP database to database warehouse.
